# Module 5 Final Project


## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 5.

Wherever we don't specify something you can fall back on the Mod4_Project specifications.

You will be able to book a feedback session for your team's project before the final delivery of your presentation where we will focus on a particular area you would like support with.

## Final Project Summary

Congratulations! You've made it through another _intense_ module, and now you're ready to show off your newfound Machine Learning skills!

All that remains for Module 5 is to complete the final project!

## The Project

For this project, you'll then use everything you've learned about Data Science and Machine Learning thus far to source a dataset, preprocess and explore it, and then build and interpret a classification model that answers your chosen question.
Model comparison and human reasoning are expected.

You will work with your partner to find a dataset and have it cleared with the instructors before you begin modeling.

## The data

We will be working with a dataset of your own choosing for this project! We ask that it has at LEAST 10K rows and can be used to solve a classification problem. Ideally you will have balanced classes for prediction (no trying to do outlier prediction! AKA predict the next hit song) and try to avoid models where you are doing multi-class prediction.

## The Deliverables

For online students, your completed project should contain the following four deliverables:

1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.

2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository and be an Executive Summary of your findings.

3. An **_"Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation_** that gives a brief overview of your problem/dataset, and each step of the CRISP-DM process.

Note: On-campus students may have different deliverables, please speak with your instructor.

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your Jupyter Notebook should meet the following specifications:

**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation. Functions live in properly named .py files
* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  

**_Process, Methodology, and Findings_**

* Your notebook should contain a clear record of your process and methodology for exploring and preprocessing your data, building and tuning a model, and interpreting your results.
* We recommend you use the CRISP-DM process to help organize your thoughts and stay on track.
* Don't forget to add a summary of this to your README.dm

## We will be paying attention to:

* CRISP-DM structure
* Problem Framing
* **Relevant** Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Transformations (only those appropriate to your application):
  - Cleaning
  - Scaling
  - Feature Engineering (what magic can you do here?)
  - Feature Selection
  - Interactions
  - Polynomial Transformations
  - Dimensionality Reduction
* Checking Learners Assumptions
* Hyper parameter Optimisation
* Model Comparison and Selection
* Train / Validation / Test (or CV where appropriate)
* Model Interpretation
* Actionable Problem-Solving Recommendations

* Properly commented and clean code

* Prediction Function
  - Take data in original format
  - Generate a prediction
  - Translate it into an action for your client
